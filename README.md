# bslib - battery storage library

Repository with code to
 
- build a **database** with relevant data from PerMod database (HTW Berlin) and "Stromspeicher-Inspektion"
- **simulate** ac- and dc-coupled battery storages with regards to electrical power (ac and dc) and state-of-charge as timeseries.

For the simulation, it is possible to calculate outputs of a **specific manufacturer + model** or alternatively for one of **2 different generic battery storage types**. 

**For reference purposes:**

## Documentation

The documentation is still under development.

## Usage

Simply install via

- `pip install bslib`

or clone repository and create environment via:

- `git clone https://github.com/RE-Lab-Projects/bslib.git`
- `conda env create --name bslib --file requirements.txt`

Afterwards you're able to create some code with `import bslib` and use the included functions `load_database`, `get_parameters` and `simulate`.

## Battery models and Group IDs
The bslib_database.csv contains the following number of battery storages, sorted by Group ID

| [Group ID]: Count | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| [S_ac]: 2 | AC-coupled |
| [S_dc]: 3 | DC-coupled |
| [INV]: 2 | PV Inverter |
